[**Exercise 1: Small, safe, steps**](./part1/tdd-mooc-small-steps-main/)
This is a refactoring exercise to practise doing small, safe steps.

**Refactor the code in [src/prices.mjs](src/prices.mjs) to replace all usages of
the [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) class with
the [Temporal.PlainDate](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/plaindate.html) class.**
